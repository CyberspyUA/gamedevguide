## Wut is this

These are my personal notes from the past 4 years that I'm transforming from our internal dev onboarding guide.

I'm aiming to process about one section a day since the conversion from onenote/evernote/confluence is lossy and needs a final human pass to clean up little niggles.

## Site Build Instructions

- Originally built with gatsby, migrating to mkdocs
- My notes related to the webdev of the site are in the gitrepo/docs folder
- Webdev is pita; I mostly use obsidian/vscode to access the markdown notes and recommend the same or another markdown app/sublime text or even [https://github1s.com/ikrima/gamedevguide](https://github1s.com/ikrima/gamedevguide) for the lazy
