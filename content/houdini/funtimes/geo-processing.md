- Heat Flow Method - Geodesic Distance
- Mobius Registration - Find correspondance between two meshes
- Vector Heat Method - Parallel transport across surface
  - Can be used for extrapolating level set velocities
  - LogMap/Exponential map
  - Geometric Medians & Karcher/Frechet means
  - Centroidal Voronoi diagrams
  - Consistently ordered landmarks (for shape correspondance across near isometric surfaces)
- Variational Cuts - Auto seam mesh
- Unwrapping Techniques
  - Boundary First Flattening - (minimizes conformal mapping energy but insight is that doesn't matter; where you place the cuts is more important)
  - Arap / Arap++ (minimizes a different energy than LSCM)
